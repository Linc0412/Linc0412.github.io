**Aloha! I am Chen Luo 😀**

I am a second-year PhD candidate at the School of Computing and Information Systems, University of Melbourne, working with Dr. A and Dr. B. Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Management Information Systems from Wuhan University of Technology, and my Master’s degree in Data Science from the University of Southern California. After graduation, I worked as a data scientist in industry in China for over three years.

My research interests focus on social media analytics, machine learning, applications of generative AI, digital innovation, and design science.

Outside of academia, I enjoy traveling, sports, and gaming. I am always open to collaboration and making new friends!
